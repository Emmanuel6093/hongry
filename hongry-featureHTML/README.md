Hongry Jiggle :musical_note:

(If youâ€™re Happy and you know it clap your hands)
If youâ€™re Hongry and you know it clip our app (*click click mouse sound) x2
If youâ€™re Hongry and you know it, 
But your pantry doesnâ€™t show it, 
If youâ€™re Hongry and you know it clip our app

## Reference websites used to learn:

We also tried to continue learning (blah blah here). We had our first experience with adding users interacting with the database to add recipes.
